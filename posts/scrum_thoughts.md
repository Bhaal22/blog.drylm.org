.. description: What is behind the scrum wording : Sprint? I try to explain my visions and why this wording is wrong.
.. type: text

Quite recently I have done a training about Scrum to a little development team (~6 people) in Rotterdam. They started the move to Scrum by themself a couple of months ago and think they do Scrum in a wrong way. Indeed they applied in the wrong way for several reasons :
<!-- TEASER_END -->

 * Project Manager / Product Owner / Scrum Master is the same person
 * Scrum Master does not play his facilitator role
 * Scrum Master does not time boxes any ceremonies
 * Only Stand Up is done

The point of this post is not to speak about this team problems, I had a long discussion with them on how they could improve their Scrum experience but one thing really annoyed me.
All the members asked questions about the development **speed**.

 * Is it true Scrum is about developing quick ?
 * How can we manage code quality when we have to develop quick ?
 * How can we increase speed sprint after sprint ?

They think doing scrum will speed them up. I tried to explain them the purpose of Scrum is not about speed but about maximizing the value delivered to the customer. Then, I think there is a misunderstanding about a Scrum wording : **Sprint**. In fact a **Sprint** is not a sprint from the running perspective.

I see more **Scrum** methodology as a marathon and not a sprint like Usain Bolt could do in Olympic games. Regarding one principle from the [Agile manifesto][1]:

>Agile processes promote sustainable development.

>The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Doing inspection during **Sprint Retrospective** and **Sprint Review** can bring some improvements items to faciliciate team working conditions but no real sprint to make ! After a sprint we cannot run anymore, and this is not we want in software engineering nor in endurance sports.

That's why I recommend to everyone using **Iteration** (which means step to achieve something) instead of **Sprint**.
